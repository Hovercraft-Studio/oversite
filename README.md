# hc-socket-server

HC Socket Server is a simple websocket server that will relay messages between clients. It also contains a small Vite frontend for testing and visibility, which uses App Store Distributed to process messages.

# Install

```bash
cd hc-socket-server
npm install
```

# Run

To start both the frontend server and the websocket server (useful for testing):

```bash
npm run start
```

To start only the websocket server:

```bash
npm run ws
```
