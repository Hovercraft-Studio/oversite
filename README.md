# hc-socket-server

**hc-socket-server** is a simple websocket server that will relay messages between clients. It also contains a small Vite frontend for testing and visibility, which uses App Store Distributed to process messages.

## Install

git clone https://github.com/Hovercraft-Studio/hc-socket-server.git
cd hc-socket-server
npm install
```

## Run

To start both the frontend server and the websocket server (useful for testing):

```bash
npm run start
```

To start only the websocket server:

```bash
npm run ws
```
